Failure to do so will lead to poor query performance. Most applications should have these options ON. When the Auto Update Statistics setting is ON, the Query Optimizer updates statistics when they are used by a query and when they might be out-of-date. Statistics become out-of-date after insert, update, delete, or merge operations change the data distribution in the table or indexed view. The Query Optimizer determines when statistics might be out-of-date by counting the number of data modifications since the last statistics update and comparing the number of modifications to a threshold. The threshold is based on the number of rows in the table or indexed view. The Query Optimizer checks for out-of-date statistics before compiling a query and before executing a cached query plan. Before compiling a query, the Query Optimizer uses the columns, tables, and indexed views in the query predicate to determine which statistics might be out-of-date. Before executing a cached query plan, the Database Engine verifies that the query plan references up-to-date statistics. The AUTO_UPDATE_STATISTICS option applies to statistics created for indexes, single-columns in query predicates, and statistics that are created by using the CREATE STATISTICS statement. This option also applies to filtered statistics.",

However, you can specify that all queries in a database be parameterized by setting the PARAMETERIZATION database option to FORCED. Regardless of whether you have a Plan-Stability or not, SQL Server will always auto parameterize your SQL Statements, and reuse the cached execution plan over and over again.

      "description": "The SQL Server Database Engine divides each physical log file internally into a number of virtual log files (VLFs). Virtual log files have no fixed size, and there is no fixed number of virtual log files for a physical log file. The Database Engine chooses the size of the virtual log files dynamically while it is creating or extending log files. The Database Engine tries to maintain a small number of virtual files. The size of the virtual files after a log file has been extended is the sum of the size of the existing log and the size of the new file increment. The size or number of virtual log files cannot be configured or set by administrators. If the log files grow to a large size in many small increments, they will have many virtual log files. This can slow down database startup and also log backup and restore operations. Conversely, if the log files are set to a large size with few or just one increment, they will have few very large virtual log files. We recommend that you assign log files a size value close to the final size required, using the required increments to achieve optimal VLF distribution, and also have a relatively large growth_increment value.",

      "description": "The Query Optimizer determines whether an index is useful for a specific query by evaluating the stored statistics. If the statistics become out of date and significant changes have occurred against the underlying data, this can result in less than optimal query performance. In most cases, it's best to let SQL Server maintain the statistics. If you turn 'Auto Create Stats' and 'Auto Update Stats' off, then it is up to you to keep the statistics up-to-date somehow. Failure to do so will lead to poor query performance. Most applications should have these options ON. When the Auto Update Statistics setting is ON, the Query Optimizer updates statistics when they are used by a query and when they might be out-of-date. Statistics become out-of-date after insert, update, delete, or merge operations change the data distribution in the table or indexed view. The Query Optimizer determines when statistics might be out-of-date by counting the number of data modifications since the last statistics update and comparing the number of modifications to a threshold. The threshold is based on the number of rows in the table or indexed view. The Query Optimizer checks for out-of-date statistics before compiling a query and before executing a cached query plan. Before compiling a query, the Query Optimizer uses the columns, tables, and indexed views in the query predicate to determine which statistics might be out-of-date. Before executing a cached query plan, the Database Engine verifies that the query plan references up-to-date statistics. The AUTO_UPDATE_STATISTICS option applies to statistics created for indexes, single-columns in query predicates, and statistics that are created by using the CREATE STATISTICS statement. This option also applies to filtered statistics.",

Windows Operating Systems divide the logical processors into groups (Kgroups). On HP ProLiant Gen9 servers, the System Firmware, by default, reports the maximum number of possible logical processors to reflect the highest core count processor available. The result is that Windows Operating Systems will group the available logical processors into more than one Kgroup in a two-socket populated configuration. Applications that rely on older kernel APIs for affnitizing threads inside a process to a specific logical processor will only be able to address one Kgroup. The result is that the process will run on fewer logical processors than are presented to the OS for use. Workloads that utilize multiple processes (in lieu of a single process with multiple threads), or are leveraging the APIs that allow beyond single Kgroup addressing, will have full access to all the logical processors presented to the OS for use.",

Improved context switching in Microsoft Windows Server 2003 has also reduced the need for fiber mode. We do not recommend that you use fiber mode scheduling for routine operation. This is because it can decrease performance by inhibiting the regular benefits of context switching, and because some components of SQL Server that use Thread Local Storage (TLS) or thread-owned objects, such as mutexes (a type of Win32 kernel object), cannot function correctly in fiber mode.",

      "description": "In some cases you may experience degraded overall performance on a Windows Server 2008 R2 or later machine when running with the default (Balanced) power plan. The issue may occur irrespective of platform and may be exhibited on both native and virtual environments. The degraded performance may increase the average response time for some tasks and cause performance issues with CPU-intensive applications. Please note that you may not notice performance issues while performing simple operations. However, applications or scripts that intensively use resources (primarily processor and memory) may exhibit the problem. To work around the performance degradation issue, you can switch to the High Performance power plan.  However, this will disable dynamic performance scaling on the platform. Depending on the environment, if the platform is always under a heavy load, then this is a viable solution.",
